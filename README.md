# Trade Guys

The Trade Guys website is the home of all things trade at CSIS, including the Trade Guys podcast, explanatory videos, analysis, and data visualizations. The site is built on top of the [Frasco](https://github.com/ixkaito/frasco/) Jekyll starter kit that utilizes gulp, Sass, Autoprefixer, PostCSS, Webpack, imagemin, & Browsersync. The sites uses [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/) for a user-friendly CMS and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to handle deploys.

### .forestry
Configuration files for the Forestry CMS live here, including the default front matter UI fields for the different content types.

### _data
The `_data` folder contains CSV, JSON, or YAML files that are used throughout the site. See [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/) for more information.

### _includes
The `_includes` folder contains the HTML for the modular pieces of the site's layout that need to be included across multiple pages. For example, `head.html` and `footer.html` are stored here. See [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/) for more information.

### _layouts
The `_layouts` folder contains the HTML for distinctive page layouts. For example, `post.html` and `archive.html`. See [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) for more information.

### _authors, _drafts, _keywords, _podcast, _posts, _series
These folder contain the markdown files for their respective content types and are called "collections" in Jekyll terminology. Each podcast, keyword, author, etc. gets its own markdown file that contains the relevant front matter and content for that particular item. Default front matter configuration is set in `config.yml` and `.forestry` configuration files. See [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/) for more information.

### _site
The compiled site files. This folder is automatically generated by Jekyll's build process. You should not make manual changes to this folder.

### admin
Forestry's remote admin panel. See the [Forestry docs](https://forestry.io/docs/editing/remote-admin/) for more information.

### assets
The assets folder contains images utilized in the layout, SASS files, the compiled CSS, and both the bundled/unbundled JavaScript. Folders prefixed with `_` are compiled on build and the compiled assets moved to the non-prefixed folders.

### gulp_tasks
Configuration for the individual gulp tasks being run.

### uploads
Media uploaded to the site is hosted here.

### [pages].md
Parent level pages on the site, such as `/about`, `/podcast`, and `/trade-explained`, are created by making a `.md` file in the root directory of the project. See [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/) for more information.
