  International trade is making headlines a lot these days. And news changes fast. A trade war with China? Bad blood between our closest allies and trading partners, like Canada? It’s hard to keep up.

  Trade experts Scott Miller and Bill Reinsch break down the buzz around trade. They get to the root of how it affects policy, and lay out how it impacts your day-to-day. Most importantly, they talk about trade in terms that everyone can understand.

  _The Trade Guys_ is hosted every week by H. Andrew Schwartz and produced by Yumi Araki at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C.
