**Kenya Electricity Generating Company** or simply **_KenGen_** is a [parastatal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-owned_enterprise "State-owned enterprise") company, and is the largest electric power producer in [Kenya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya "Kenya") producing about 75% of the electricity consumed in the country.

  
**KenGen** relies on various sources to generate electricity ranging from hydropower, geothermal, thermal and wind. Hydropower is the leading source, with an installed capacity of 818 [MW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megawatt "Megawatt"), which is 52.3% of the company's installed capacity

KPC was managed by the [Kenya Power and Lighting Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya_Power_and_Lighting_Company "Kenya Power and Lighting Company") under a management contract. In January 1997, the management of KPC was formally separated from Kenya Power as a direct result of reforms being under taken in the energy sector and the entire economy.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya_Electricity_Generating_Company#cite_note-GSB-6) Subsequently, on 19 January 1998 the company changed its name from Kenya Power Company to Kenya Electricity Generating Company. The trading name **KenGen PLC** was also adopted at this point.

In 2006, KenGen was listed on the [Nairobi Securities Exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nairobi_Securities_Exchange "Nairobi Securities Exchange") after the Government of Kenya sold 30 percent of its stake in the company through a successful [initial public offering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering "Initial public offering") that received over 280,000 applications.
