Ever wondered how Kenya's largest dam came to be. Today we get candid with our guest to discuss just that.

### "The primary purpose of the **dam** is hydroelectric power generation and it supports a 72 megawatts (97,000 hp) power station.

The **Kindaruma Hydroelectric Power Station**, also **Kindaruma Dam** is an [embankment dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embankment_dam "Embankment dam") with two [gravity dam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_dam "Gravity dam") sections on the [Tana River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tana_River_(Kenya) "Tana River (Kenya)") in Kenya. It straddles the border of [Embu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embu_County "Embu County") and [Machakos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machakos_County "Machakos County") counties in [Kenya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya "Kenya"). The primary purpose of the dam is [hydroelectric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectric "Hydroelectric") power generation and it supports a 72 megawatts (97,000 hp) power station. It is Kenya's first post-independence hydroelectric power plant. It was commissioned in 1968 as part of the [Seven Forks Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectric_power_in_Kenya#Seven_Forks_Scheme "Hydroelectric power in Kenya"). 

**Why it matters:** The dam has been powering Kenya for over 56 years

**Key question:** Who operates the Kindaruma dam?

### "The power station is operated by Kengen."
