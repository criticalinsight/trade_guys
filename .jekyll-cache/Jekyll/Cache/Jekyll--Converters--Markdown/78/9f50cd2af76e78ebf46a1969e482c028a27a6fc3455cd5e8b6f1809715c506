I"ù<p>After roughly a year and a half of overtures from the Trump administration, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has agreed to enter into talks for a â€œUnited States-Japan Trade Agreement on goods,â€ and other key areas. The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/joint-statement-united-states-japan/">joint statementÂ </a>announcing the negotiations was released on Sept. 26 on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly after a bilateral meeting between President Trump and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Questions remain, however, about the scope of the negotiations, the resolution of U.S. national security tariffs on steel, aluminum and automobiles, and what either side may be willing to give to the other to reach a deal.</p>
