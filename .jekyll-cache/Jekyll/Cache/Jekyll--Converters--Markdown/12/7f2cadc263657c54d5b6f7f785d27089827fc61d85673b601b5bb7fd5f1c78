I"´<p>I attended a dinner last week where the topic of the United States-Canada-Mexico Trade Agreement (USMCA) came up, with the central question focused on the significance of the agreement. One guest put it in the â€œdid no harmâ€ categoryâ€”a lot of constructive tweaks on digital trade, intellectual property, state-owned enterprises, and other â€œupgradesâ€ Iâ€™ve discussed in previous columns, and compromises on most of the more unsettling administration demands like a sunset clause. However, others, including me, offered a more ominous interpretationâ€”USMCA, along with some other initiatives, essentially heralds a return to managed trade, albeit a soft one, at least so far.</p>
