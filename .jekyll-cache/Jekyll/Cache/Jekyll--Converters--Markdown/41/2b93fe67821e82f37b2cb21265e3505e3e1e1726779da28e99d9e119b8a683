I"ª<p>U.S. consumers love choices. But, choice in the U.S. market means American manufacturers face stiff competition at home and abroad.  Take washing machines for example. Some washing machines are front-loading, some are top-loading. Machines hold different sized loads and use different amounts of water. Some take longer per load than others. Some have auto soap dispensers, and some are even â€œsmartâ€ enough to let you tell Amazonâ€™s Alexa to â€œstart the wash.â€ Itâ€™s competitive.  In January 2018, President Trump approved a safeguard on washing machine manufacturers in the U.S. However, what temporarily helps a producer likely wonâ€™t help the American consumer.</p>
