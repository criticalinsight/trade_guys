I"Ç<p>Ahead of his meeting with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in Washington, President Trump tweeted, â€œTariffs are the greatest!â€ as a warning to trade partners that they should be negotiating â€œfair deals.â€ The Trade Guys discuss whether this is a harbinger of the presidentâ€™s latest plan to slap 25 percent tariffs on foreign autos and auto parts as the administration makes the argument that auto imports may be a threat to national security. But at a hearing at the Commerce Department last week, representatives from the auto industry appeared to disagree with that assessment. So, whoâ€™s right? Who wins and who loses when tariffs are placed on imported cars and car parts?</p>
